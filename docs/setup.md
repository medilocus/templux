# Setup

This page contains instructions on how to set up your files to use Templux.

## Python Modules

The required modules for Templux are:

* pygame
* numpy

Install these with the command `pip install <package>` or use the file `requirements.txt`, and do `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Download Module

First, you need to download the pre-written Templux module.

You have two options:

* Download the latest release from the [releases page][releases].
* Download the latest commit from the [main branch][latest].

Take the folder named `templux` and delete everything else.

## File Structure

Setup your files in this format:

```
templux      # The folder that was downloaded
filename.py   # Python file which will be run
```
